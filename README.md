**TriviaKing** is a cross-platform online game that follows a similar structure to the popular game show “Who Wants to be a Millionaire” but with some unique attributes and a beautiful UI design. Throughout the gameplay, the user will be presented with questions that have an increasing difficulty on various interesting catergories that the user can choose from. Users can launch the website from their devices, create an account, login,  and immediately start playing to rack up points to get on the leaderboard.
